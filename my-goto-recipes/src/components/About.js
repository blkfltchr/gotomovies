        <h1>How I built this</h1>
        <p>Unsure what to create exactly, I did some brainstorming. I knew some of the features I wanted but I wasn’t concept to pursue to implement them. Some of the features included: Card display, Add/remove cards, Dynamic linking, reactstrap components, and more.</p>
        <p>I didn’t want to do a to-do list or a note taking app but I wanted to continue down that line of thinking. I talked to my mother and we came up with some sort of tracker. Maybe a goal tracker? Finally - probably because I was hungry at the time - I settled on a recipe tracker.</p>
